- [x] should use null-ls setup() instead of lspconfig setup()
- [x] context sensitive help (for at least imports)
- [x] go doc shift immediately to -all or -all -src or back to basic
- [x] compare null-ls builtins against custom goldsmith code
- [x] 'max_errs' for linters (golangci-lint/revive) should be user configurable
- [x] extra keys for null items should be validated
- [ ] use vim.lsp.buf.server_ready
- 1.18
    - [ ] module_path() may break with 1.18 ('go list -m' will potentially return more than one module)
    - [ ] fuzzy testing
- gopls 0.8
    - look at release notes and see what can be used: https://github.com/golang/tools/releases/tag/gopls%2Fv0.8.0
- [ ] support lsp-format.nvim
- [ ] warn if ts parsers are not available for go/gomod
- [ ] revive reports a version
- [ ] investigate richgo
- [ ] investigate using tests without json middleman
- [ ] check why the 'only' key for organizeImports isn't working as expected
- [ ] improve startup time -- unsurprisingly pretty much entirely located in tools.check() which does many fs checks and
      runs some programs (to get the version). This will need to be done asynchronously to improve the startup time.
- [ ] support passing functions for key mappings
- [ ] qf window often attached to wrong buffer (uncertain?)
- [ ] https://github.com/golang/vscode-go - steal ideas from here, if any
- [ ] explain the template stuff for :GoAddTest\* (gotests docs are non-existent)
- [ ] perhaps timeouts for jobs?
- [ ] linter/fmt
    - [x] use multiple_files where needed
    - [ ] more ability to override
    - [ ] stats for all
    - [ ] :GoCreateConfigs: ability to have templates? or other files instead of the builtin ones
    - [ ] perhaps rethink how linters etc... with config files are handled
- [ ] tests
