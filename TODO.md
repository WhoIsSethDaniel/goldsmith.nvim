- [x] should use null-ls setup() instead of lspconfig setup()
- [x] context sensitive help (for at least imports)
- [x] go doc shift immediately to -all or -all -src or back to basic
- [x] compare null-ls builtins against custom goldsmith code
- [ ] improve startup time
- [ ] qf window often attached to wrong buffer (uncertain?)
- [ ] stats for null-ls
- [ ] stats for gopls startup 
- [ ] support passing functions for key mappings
- [ ] https://github.com/golang/vscode-go - steal ideas from here, if any
- [ ] explain the template stuff for :GoAddTest\* (gotests docs are non-existent)
- [ ] perhaps timeouts for jobs?
- [ ] linter/fmt config
    - [ ] :GoCreateConfigs: ability to have templates? or other files instead of the builtin ones
    - [ ] perhaps rethink how linters etc... with config files are handled
- [ ] tests
